## Description

_This is a website where a user can view what flavors of kombucha the kombucha house has. User can also check the price and description of each kombucha. As the kombucha is sold, there is a button for each flavor that will keep track of how many pints are left in each keg. Persistence to retain pint count number is not yet implemented. _
